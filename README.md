## What it is
A bookmarking plugin for use with Semantic Synchrony. After installing this plugin into Chrome, you will see the Semantic Synchrony icon (a red circle and a blue triangle connected by an S, plus a few more lines) in the corner of your browser.

Clicking on that will copy some text describing the webpage to your clipboard, formatted for pasting into Semantic Synchrony: The pasted node's title will be the web page's title, and the node will have an @alias property equal to the web page's URL. The new node behaves like a hyperlink; the shortcut C-c C-t C-a b allows you to visit the webpage in your browser from Semantic Synchrony.

## How to install it
Follow [these directions](https://www.howtogeek.com/120743/how-to-install-extensions-from-outside-the-chrome-web-store/) for installing a Chrome plugin from outside of the Chrome Store (an "unpacked extension"). When Chrome asks you for a file path, give it the folder into which you cloned this repository.
